# Advent of Code in ClavaScript

The goal of this repo is to exercise ClavaScript on Advent of Code puzzles to
find bugs and missing features. Please submit your solution and anything you
find in ClavaScript that needs fixing as an issue.

Run `npm install` to install ClavaScript.

Then run:

```
$ node node_modules/.bin/clava run 2021/aoc01_borkdude.cljs
```

to compile and run a solution.

After compilation you should be able to run the solution with Node.js (or bun) only:


```
$ node 2021/aoc01_borkdude.mjs
```
